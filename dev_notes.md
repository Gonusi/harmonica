App must show a visual representation of 10 C diatonic harmonica holes and their respective keys
When a sound is played to the mic, if it is in the range of any harmonica keys, that key is highlighted and inside
a line is shown indicating pitch relative to exact pitch of that key.

For example, if key A4 is at 440hz, and the sound is at 435hz, the line would be slightly below the center of
that key indicating you're "bending" the key a bit.

The keys are clickable and play a generated tone.
